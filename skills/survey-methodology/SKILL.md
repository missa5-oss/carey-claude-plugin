# Survey Methodology

## Survey Design Principles

### 1. Define Clear Objectives
Before writing questions, clearly articulate:
- Primary research questions
- Key decisions the data will inform
- Target metrics and benchmarks
- How results will be analyzed

### 2. Know Your Audience
Consider:
- Respondent literacy level
- Cultural considerations
- Device usage (mobile vs. desktop)
- Time availability
- Incentive expectations

## Question Types

### Closed-Ended Questions

#### Single Select (Radio Buttons)
Best for: Mutually exclusive choices
```
Which program are you enrolled in?
○ Full-time MBA
○ Part-time MBA
○ Executive MBA
○ MS in Finance
○ Other graduate program
```

#### Multi-Select (Checkboxes)
Best for: Non-exclusive choices (select all that apply)
```
Which factors influenced your decision to apply? (Select all)
☐ Program reputation
☐ Location
☐ Career outcomes
☐ Faculty expertise
☐ Alumni network
```

#### Likert Scales
Best for: Measuring attitudes and agreement

**5-Point Scale:**
- Strongly Disagree
- Disagree
- Neither Agree nor Disagree
- Agree
- Strongly Agree

**7-Point Scale** (greater sensitivity):
1 = Strongly Disagree ... 7 = Strongly Agree

#### Semantic Differential
Best for: Brand perception, attribute ratings
```
Rate Carey Business School on each dimension:
Innovative [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Traditional
Theoretical [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Practical
```

#### Net Promoter Score (NPS)
Best for: Loyalty measurement
```
How likely are you to recommend Carey to a colleague?
0 (Not at all likely) -------- 10 (Extremely likely)
```
- Detractors: 0-6
- Passives: 7-8
- Promoters: 9-10
- NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors

#### Matrix Questions
Best for: Rating multiple items on same scale
```
Rate your satisfaction with each:
                    Very      Somewhat    Neutral    Somewhat    Very
                    Dissatis. Dissatis.             Satisfied   Satisfied
Course quality        ○          ○          ○          ○          ○
Faculty               ○          ○          ○          ○          ○
Career services       ○          ○          ○          ○          ○
```

#### Ranking Questions
Best for: Prioritization
```
Rank the following from most (1) to least (5) important:
___ Salary potential
___ Work-life balance
___ Career advancement
___ Job security
___ Meaningful work
```

### Open-Ended Questions
Best for: Exploratory insights, quotes for reporting
```
What could Carey do to improve your experience?
[________________________________]
```

## Survey Flow Best Practices

### Question Order
1. **Screener questions** - Qualify respondents
2. **Warm-up questions** - Easy, engaging questions
3. **Core questions** - Primary research objectives
4. **Sensitive questions** - Demographics, income
5. **Open-ended questions** - Comments, suggestions
6. **Thank you** - Express appreciation

### Skip Logic Examples
```
Q1: Have you attended a Carey event?
    ○ Yes → Continue to Q2
    ○ No → Skip to Q5

Q2: Which event did you attend?
    [Event list]
```

### Piping
Reference previous answers:
```
You indicated you're interested in [Q3_Response].
What specifically interests you about this program?
```

## Question Writing Guidelines

### Do:
- Use simple, clear language
- Ask one thing at a time
- Provide balanced response options
- Include "Not applicable" when relevant
- Randomize response order (except scales)

### Don't:
- Use double-barreled questions
- Use leading or biased language
- Use jargon or acronyms
- Assume knowledge
- Use double negatives

### Examples

**Bad:** "How satisfied are you with the quality and speed of career services?"
**Good:** Ask as two separate questions

**Bad:** "Don't you agree that Carey provides excellent education?"
**Good:** "How would you rate the quality of education at Carey?"

## Survey Length Guidelines

| Audience | Recommended Length |
|----------|-------------------|
| General population | 5-10 minutes |
| Customers/students | 10-15 minutes |
| Engaged stakeholders | 15-20 minutes |
| In-depth research | 20-30 minutes |

## Quality Control Questions

### Attention Checks
```
Please select "Agree" for this question.
○ Strongly Disagree
○ Disagree
○ Neither
○ Agree ← Correct
○ Strongly Agree
```

### Speeder Detection
Flag respondents completing in < 1/3 median time

### Straight-liner Detection
Flag identical responses across all matrix items

## Mobile Optimization

- Use single-column layouts
- Limit matrix questions (or break into pages)
- Use larger touch targets
- Test on multiple devices
- Keep questions visible without scrolling
