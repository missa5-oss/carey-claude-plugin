# Industry Analysis Frameworks

## Porter's Five Forces

Analyze industry competitiveness and profitability potential.

### 1. Threat of New Entrants
**Factors to assess:**
- Capital requirements
- Economies of scale
- Brand loyalty and switching costs
- Access to distribution channels
- Regulatory barriers
- Proprietary technology

**Questions:**
- How easy is it for new competitors to enter?
- What barriers protect incumbents?

### 2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers
**Factors to assess:**
- Number of suppliers
- Uniqueness of inputs
- Switching costs
- Forward integration threat
- Importance to supplier's business

**Questions:**
- Can suppliers raise prices or reduce quality?
- How dependent is the industry on specific suppliers?

### 3. Bargaining Power of Buyers
**Factors to assess:**
- Buyer concentration
- Purchase volume
- Product differentiation
- Switching costs
- Price sensitivity
- Backward integration threat

**Questions:**
- Can buyers demand lower prices or better terms?
- How much choice do buyers have?

### 4. Threat of Substitutes
**Factors to assess:**
- Availability of substitutes
- Price-performance trade-off
- Switching costs
- Buyer propensity to switch

**Questions:**
- What alternatives exist outside the industry?
- How attractive are substitute options?

### 5. Industry Rivalry
**Factors to assess:**
- Number of competitors
- Industry growth rate
- Fixed costs and capacity
- Product differentiation
- Exit barriers

**Questions:**
- How intense is competition?
- What drives competitive behavior?

## PESTEL Analysis

### Political

- Environmental regulations

### Economic
- Economic growth rates
- Interest rates
- Inflation
- Exchange rates
- Unemployment trends

### Social
- Demographics
- Cultural trends
- Education levels
- Health consciousness
- Lifestyle changes

### Technological
- R&D activity
- Automation trends

### Environmental
- Climate change impacts
- Sustainability pressures
- Resource scarcity
- Carbon regulations
- Waste management

### Legal
- Industry regulations

## Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
Total market demand for a product/service

**Calculation approaches:**
1. **Top-down**: Industry reports, government data
2. **Bottom-up**: Unit economics × total potential customers
3. **Value theory**: Value delivered × willingness to pay

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
Portion of TAM targeted by your products/services

**Factors:**
- Geographic reach
- Product fit
- Channel access
- Regulatory constraints

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
Realistic market share you can capture

**Factors:**
- Current market share
- Competitive position
- Growth trajectory
- Resource constraints

### Example Framework
```
TAM: US graduate business education market = $50B
├── SAM: Part-time/flexible MBA programs = $15B
│   └── SOM: Mid-Atlantic region, target demographics = $500M
│       └── Carey realistic capture (3-5 years) = $25-50M
```
