# Qualitative Research Methods

## Focus Group Research

### Planning Considerations

#### Group Composition
- **Size**: 6-8 participants ideal (min 5, max 10)
- **Homogeneity**: Similar characteristics within groups
- **Segmentation**: Separate groups by key variables
- **Strangers**: Avoid friends/colleagues in same group

#### Number of Groups
- Minimum 2 groups per segment
- Continue until saturation (no new insights)
- Typical study: 4-8 groups

#### Session Length
- Standard: 90 minutes
- Extended: 120 minutes
- Mini-groups (4-5): 60-90 minutes

### Moderator Guide Structure

```markdown
## Introduction (10 min)
- Welcome and thank participants
- Explain purpose (general terms)
- Ground rules (confidentiality, one at a time, no wrong answers)
- Consent and recording permission
- Participant introductions

## Warm-Up (10 min)
- Easy, engaging opening questions
- Build rapport and comfort
- Get everyone talking early

## Core Discussion (60-80 min)
### Topic 1 (20 min)
- Main question
- Probing questions
- Stimulus/activity (if applicable)

### Topic 2 (20 min)
- Main question
- Probing questions

### Topic 3 (20 min)
- Main question
- Probing questions

## Wrap-Up (10 min)
- Summary of key points
- Final thoughts/advice
- Thank participants
```

### Probing Techniques

| Technique | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Clarification | Unclear response | "What do you mean by...?" |
| Elaboration | Brief response | "Tell me more about that" |
| Example | Abstract concept | "Can you give an example?" |
| Comparison | Differentiation | "How does X compare to Y?" |
| Feeling | Emotional insight | "How did that make you feel?" |
| Silent probe | Encourage continuation | Pause and nod |

### Stimulus Materials

- **Concept boards**: Test ideas, messaging
- **Prototypes**: Evaluate designs
- **Competitor materials**: Benchmarking
- **Projective exercises**: Uncover latent attitudes

## In-Depth Interviews (IDIs)

### When to Use IDIs vs. Focus Groups

| Use IDIs When | Use Focus Groups When |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Sensitive topics | Group dynamics matter |
| Expert informants | Idea generation needed |
| Detailed individual journey | Social norms influence behavior |
| Hard-to-recruit participants | Reaction to others' views valuable |
| Geographic dispersion | Building on others' ideas |

### IDI Structure

#### Duration
- Standard: 45-60 minutes
- Executive interviews: 30-45 minutes
- Expert deep-dives: 60-90 minutes

#### Interview Guide Format
```markdown
## Introduction (5 min)
- Thank participant
- Explain purpose
- Confirm consent/recording

## Background (10 min)
- Role/position
- Relevant experience
- Context setting

## Core Topics (30-40 min)
- Key questions with probes
- Flexibility to follow insights

## Closing (5 min)
- Anything else to add?
- Thank participant
```

### Interview Techniques

#### Laddering
Move from attributes → consequences → values
```
"You mentioned flexibility is important..."
"What does flexibility give you?"
"Why is that important to you?"
```

#### Critical Incident Technique
```
"Tell me about a specific time when..."
"Walk me through exactly what happened"
"What were you thinking at that moment?"
```

#### Think-Aloud Protocol
```
"As you look at this website, tell me everything
you're thinking and noticing..."
```

## Qualitative Analysis

### Coding Process

1. **Familiarization**: Read all transcripts
2. **Initial coding**: Generate codes from data
3. **Organize codes**: Group into themes
4. **Review themes**: Check against data
5. **Define themes**: Name and describe
6. **Report**: Write up with quotes

### Thematic Analysis Framework

```
Theme 1: [Name]
├── Sub-theme 1a
│   └── Representative quote
├── Sub-theme 1b
│   └── Representative quote
└── Sub-theme 1c
    └── Representative quote
```

### Quote Selection Criteria
- Represents broader pattern
- Clearly articulates the point
- Authentic voice preserved
- Context included when needed
- Diverse voices represented

## Recruitment Best Practices

### Screener Design
- Verify eligibility criteria
- Include security questions
- Avoid leading to "correct" answers
- Over-recruit by 20-25%

### Incentive Guidelines

| Participant Type | Focus Group | IDI |
|-----------------|-------------|-----|
| General consumers | $75-125 | $50-100 |
| Business professionals | $150-250 | $100-200 |
| C-suite executives | $300-500 | $250-400 |
| Medical professionals | $250-400 | $200-350 |

### Confirmation Process
- Send calendar invite
- Reminder 1 week before
- Reminder day before
- Reminder day of (2 hours)
